[We fired our top talent. Best decision we ever made.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/we-fired-our-top-talent-best-decision-we-ever-made-4c0a99728fde)

# 我们把最厉害的人炒掉了，这是我们做过最正确的决定

“You will never be able to understand any of what I’ve created. I am Albert F***ing Einstein and you are all monkeys scrabbling in the dirt.”

“你们不会理解我创造的一切。我TMD就是爱因斯坦，你们都是玩泥巴的小屁孩。”

And so our resident genius, our Dr. Jekyll, explosively completed his transformation into Mr. Hyde.

我们的天才 Jekyll 医生愤怒的变身为 Hyde。（经典小说，善良的医生Jekyll，他将自己当作实验对象，结果却导致人格分裂，变成夜晚会转为邪恶Hyde的双重人格）

He declared this in front of the product design team, developers, management, and pre-launch customers. One of our project sponsors had the temerity to ask when the problem crippling our product would be fixed.

他是在产品设计小组、开发人员、管理人员和试用用户面前说出的这句话。我们项目的赞助商之一鲁莽的询问我们的产品何时修复严重缺陷。

Genius is a fickle beast. Sometimes you have the good fortune to work with a mad genius. Other times you are doomed to work with pure madness. There are also times when it is hard to tell the difference.

天才都是反复无常的野兽。运气好时和你共事的是个疯狂的天才，其他时候他只是纯粹的疯狂。大多时候很难区分这两者。

This story is about the fall from grace of an extremely gifted team member with a deep understanding of our product’s architecture. He had an uncanny ability to forecast future requirements, and a ton of domain-specific knowledge.

这个故事关于一名天才团队成员的陨落，他对我们的产品架构有深入理解，有预测未来需求的不可思议的能力，有大量专业领域知识积累。

He was our top contributor. He was killing our flagship project.
We’ll call this person “Rick.”

他是贡献最多的成员。他曾驾驭我们的旗舰项目。我们叫他 Rick 好了。（出自高分动画「瑞克和莫蒂」，豆瓣评分9.8）

>你不会想让这个家伙在你的团队里的。

Rick was universally recognized on the team as the top talent. He was the lead developer and architect of our software projects.

Rick 是团队里公认的天才。他是首席开发工程师及项目架构师。

Any time anyone had a question about code or needed help with a task, they would go to Rick. Rick had a giant whiteboard installed in his office used only for this purpose. It was always cluttered with the ghosts of past discussions that wouldn’t quite erase.

任何时候任何人有关于代码的问题或任务需要帮忙，他们都会找 Rick。Rick 在办公室装了一块白板专门处理这种事情。白板上总留有无法擦去的凌乱痕迹记录过去的讨论。

Any time there was a particularly challenging problem, Rick would handle it. Rick had a server with the same specs as our production server installed at his desk. He used this to run the entire application stack independently and troubleshoot every layer at once.

无论什么时候出现特别有挑战性的问题，Rick 会处理它。Rick 电脑上安装了与生产环境服务器参数相同的服务器。他可以用这个服务器独立运行整个应用程序栈，同时在应用各个层面排查问题。

Rick didn’t need anybody else. Rick preferred to work alone in his private work-space.

Rick 不依赖任何人。他喜欢孤军奋战在他的私人工作间。

Rick didn’t need anything anybody else built. He built everything he needed from scratch because it was infinitely better than the paltry offerings of mere mortals.

Rick 从不需要别人造好的轮子。他什么都自己造，从无到有，因为自己造的轮子比其他凡人做的平庸之物要好太多。

Soon, Rick stopped attending meetings. Rick didn’t have time for meetings any more because there was too much to code.

很快，Rick 不再参加会议。因为太多代码需要编写，他没有时间参加会议。

Rick closed his door. His whiteboard lay fallow. Rick no longer had time to train anyone because he had too much to solve on his own.

Rick 关上工作间的门，白板也闲置了。他没有时间指导别人，因为他自己有很多事情需要解决。

A backlog grew behind Rick. Bugs were popping up in old tools he’d built. They sapped his attention from meeting commitments on new product development.

Rick 身后开始积压工作。他造的轮子也开始出现 bug。这些压榨了他投入在新产品开发上的精力。

Of course, these bugs were happening because the users had misstated their assumptions. Of course there wasn’t any problem in his work. Of course.

当然，这些 bug 出现是由于使用者操作不当，Rick 的工作没有任何问题。

On our project dashboard, green flags changed to yellow. Yellow changed to red. Red lights started blinking. One by one, task statuses changed to “Impeded.” Everyone was waiting for Rick.

在我们的项目仪表盘上，标志由绿色变成了黄色，黄色又变成了红色，红色的灯疯狂闪烁。任务一个又一个陷入不可用状态。所有人都在等待 Rick 处理。

>Don’t worry, Rick will handle it. All of it. (source)
>不必担心，Rick 会把这些全都解决掉。

The project manager got a six-month extension from the sponsor. At the end of the six months, production-readiness was estimated to be seven months away. At the end of a year, production-readiness was two years out.

项目经理从赞助商那里获得了六个月的延期。六个月到了，生产准备预计还要七个月。等到一年过去了，生产准备两年了。

Rick was churning out code faster than ever. He was working seven-day weeks, twelve hours a day.

Rick 比之前更加高效地产出代码。他每周工作七天，每天工作十二个小时。

Everyone knew only Rick could pull the team out of this mess. Everyone held their breath and waited for Rick to invent the miracle cure that would mend this crippled project.

每个人都知道只有 Rick 能拯救团队。大家屏住呼吸等待 Rick 创造特效良药，将项目起死回生。

Every day, Rick grew more belligerent and isolated. The mask was coming off. Jekyll was becoming Hyde.

每天，Rick 的孤立感和好战心都在增加。面具逐渐脱离，Jekyll 变成了 Hyde。

I participated in my first meeting with the project team about two years after the original agreed release date. I’d been aware of the project for a while, because it had grown infamous in my organization, but hadn’t been assigned to it.

我和项目团队第一次会议有关项目延期的两年。我突然意识到这个项目，因为它在公司里声名狼藉，我也是刚刚指派到这个项目。

I was sent in to see if we could save it.

我被指派进来，看看我们能不能拯救项目。

My first meeting on the project was the aforementioned “Albert Einstein” meeting.

我和这个项目有关的第一场会面便是上面提到的“爱因斯坦”。

Hmm.

嗯······

I dove into the source code. Rick was right: no-one could possibly understand what Rick had created. Except for Rick. It was a reflection of the workings of his own mind. Some of it was very clever, a lot of it was copy-pasta, it was all very idiosyncratic, and it was not at all documented.

我看了源码。Rick 说得对，除了他自己，没人理解他创造的东西。这些全都是他自己思维的工作产物。其中一些很巧妙，大部分还是复制粘贴的。它们都很独特，并不是所有东西都有文档。

I went to our CIO with the verdict. Only Rick would ever be able to maintain this product. Plus, every day that Rick worked on the project moved the delivery date back a week. Rick was destroying our product faster than he was creating it.

我给了我们的 CIO（首席信息官）一份报告。只有 Rick 能够维护这个产品。另外，Rick 每工作一天都会让项目交付延期一周。他对项目的破坏速度比创造速度要快。

We sat down with Rick and had a conversation about his role in the project. We reviewed our concerns. We sidestepped his self-comparison to Albert Einstein.
We explained our new strategy. The team was going to collaborate on building a new product from scratch.

我们和 Rick 坐下来讨论他在项目中的角色。我们评估了关注点。我们回避了他和爱因斯坦的比较。我们解释了新的战略。团队需要合作，从零开始构建一个新产品。

This effort would be very limited in scope and would only provide the bare essentials to get us to production. The whole team would contribute and be able to support it. No more bottlenecks.

我们的努力必须限制在一定范围内，并且仅仅完成产品基础功能。整个团队贡献代码并可以提供技术支持。不再会有瓶颈。

How did Rick react to this?

Rick 对此作何反应？

The only way Rick could. Rick exploded.

Rick 选择了一如既往风格，瞬间爆炸。

Rick wanted no part of this farce. If we couldn’t appreciate his genius, that was our fault, not his. Rick predicted that within months we’d come crawling back to him begging him to save us.

Rick 并不想理会这场闹剧。认为如果我们不能欣赏他的天赋，那就是我们的问题，而不是他的问题。Rick 预计不出一个月我们会狼狈而归乞求他拯救我们。

Rick screamed that we lacked the basic mental capacity to appreciate genius when it was staring us in the face.

Rick 向我们咆哮说我们庙太小，容不下他这尊佛。

Sadly, after this, Rick rejected months of overtures by leadership. He refused to take time off or allow any work to be delegated. He rejected repeated attempts to introduce free open source frameworks to replace his hard-to-maintain bespoke tools.

很遗憾，这之后，Rick 拒绝了领导的未来几个月的安排。他拒绝休息，也不同意工作移交他人。他屡次拒绝引入免费开源的框架来替代他自己的难以维护的定制工具。

He reverted code changes — including tested bug fixes — by other developers. He asserted that he wouldn’t be held accountable for supporting other people’s work. He continued publicly belittling his colleagues.

他回退了其他开发者测试修复 bug 的代码变更。他宣称自己没有责任支持其他同事的工作。他不断公开藐视同事。

We fired Rick.

我们解雇了 Rick。

It took about a week for the dust to settle. It took time for the shocked team to gather themselves after losing their embattled guru.

整整一周时间才尘埃落定。失去大将的军队需要一定时间来稳定军心。

Then I saw them huddled around a whiteboard.

然后我看到他们在白板前挤作一团。

>Collaboration. Rick had never seen this before. (source)
>合作。Rick 从不懂这个词


They collaborated. They designed a replacement product. It would be much simpler.

他们开始合作，一起设计更简单的替代产品。

It wouldn’t have all the bells and whistles. Nor would it anticipate requirements from five years down the product road map.

新产品没有华而不实东西，也没有根据五年后的产品路线来预计需求。

Rick’s product supported a dynamic workflow with over fifteen thousand permutations. In reality 99% of our use cases followed one of three paths. The team hard-coded the workflow. This removed over 30% of Rick’s work.

Rick 的产品动态工作流支持超过一万五千种排列。事实上，我们 99% 的用例只遵循其中三分之一的路径。团队对工作流硬编码。这移除了超过 30% Rick 的工作。

It wouldn’t have custom hand-coded components for every task. They stripped out every bespoke dependency that they could buy instead of build.

每个任务并不能使用定制的硬编码组件。他们把能购买到的组件替换掉自己定制构建的组件。

This removed hundreds of hours of Rick’s contribution. But it also removed thousands of hours of technical debt.

这移除了 Rick 上百小时的贡献。当然这也移除了上千小时的技术债务（technical debt）。

We obtained an agreement from the project sponsor to shut off some edge-case functionality.

我们和项目赞助商协商达成一致，砍掉一些边缘功能。

This had served only 5% of our pre-launch user group and was responsible for about a quarter of the product’s complexity.

这些功能只服务于 5% 的试用用户组，但给在产品中占有四分之一的复杂度。

We re-released the product to this group. It consisted of 10% of Rick’s original code which was pretty stable. It also had a few thousand lines of new code to replace about 150,000 lines of incomprehensible mess.

我们向试用用户组重新发布产品。产品包含 Rick 写的稳定运行的 10% 的源代码，另外用几千行新代码替换掉了十五万行难以理解的代码。

The team had replaced five years of work in about six months. Over the next few months we expanded from pilot to full customer release.

整个团队六个月完成了五年的工作量。接下来几个月时间我们把试用版扩展为完整的客户版本。

Not only had we replaced what Rick had built, we sped past him and fully launched the product — all in under a year. The result was less than a fifth the size and complexity of what Rick had built.

我们不仅替换掉 Rick 造的轮子，而且超越他并全面推出了产品，所有这一切只用了不到一年时间。产品的大小和复杂度只有 Rick 所做的五分之一。

It was also hundreds of times faster and nearly bug-free despite having been assembled in a fraction of the time and serving ten times as many customers.

尽管产品组装时间很短，使用的客户翻了十倍，但产品的效率仍提升上百倍，而且几乎没有 bug。

The team went back to Rick’s other products. They threw away his old code there, too.

团队回到 Rick 其他产品中，他们剔除了 Rick 的旧代码。

They re-released another product of his after three years in development, with three months of concerted team effort.

团队协作三个月就重新发布了 Rick 三年时间开发的产品。

There were no Ricks left on the team. We didn’t have any mad geniuses building everything from scratch. But our productivity was never higher.

团队中不再有 Rick 这种人。我们也不再看到这种从无到有造轮子疯狂的天才。但我们的生产力居高不下。

Rick was a very talented developer. Rick could solve complex business logic problems and create sophisticated architectures to support his lofty designs. Rick could not solve the problem of how to work effectively on a team.

Rick 是名非常有天赋的开发者。他能够解决复杂的商业逻辑问题，可以创造复杂精妙的结构来支持他的高级设计。Rick 不能解决的问题是如何使团队高效工作。

Rick’s presence was destructive in several ways.

Rick 的存在在某些方面是有破坏性的。

First, he created a cult of dependence. Any problem eventually became a Rick problem, a myth he encouraged. Developers learned to stop trying and just wait for Rick.

首先，他创造了个人崇拜的依赖。所有问题都变成 Rick 的问题，他变成一个神话。开发者习惯放弃尝试，只等着 Rick 解决。

Second, he didn’t write maintainable code. He never documented or tested anything, and so failed in spite of his own intelligence. His belief in his personal infallibility trumped common sense.

其次，他写的代码不易维护。他从不写文档或测试代码，他的聪明才智也无法阻止失败。他对自己可靠性的信仰让他忽略了常识。

Third, he was personally destructive. Team members didn’t want to speak up and offer their own ideas because he always berated them for it. Rick only respected Rick and went out of his way to make everyone else feel small.

然后，他个人有破坏性。团队成员不想和他交流想法，因为他总是批判他们。Rick 只尊重它自己，以他自己的方式生活，让其他人感觉渺小。

Fourth, he lacked all personal accountability. No failure was his fault. He sincerely believed this, and it prevented him from learning from his own mistakes.

最后，他缺少个人责任感。所有失败都不是他的错。他坚信这一点，这也阻止了他从错误中学习和进步。

I don’t believe Rick started out this way. I saw him at his worst. This was after years of working escalating overtime and facing increasing criticism from customers and colleagues.

我并不认为 Rick 从开始就这个样子。我看到的是他最糟糕的样子。他经历了数年愈演愈烈的加班，面对了同事和客户逐渐增加的苛刻要求。

It’s sad that Rick descended this far. His manager shares in this responsibility. In fact, the original management team was held accountable: they were let go first.

很遗憾，Rick 走远了。他的经理也有责任。事实上，原来的管理团队承担了责任，他们首先离开了。

Unfortunately Rick was so far gone that he couldn’t, or wouldn’t, be brought back. No amount of coaching, feedback, time off, or assignment to other projects changed his toxic behavior.

不幸的是 Rick 走的太远了，以至于他不能回到正轨。即使再多的辅导、反馈、休假或指派其他项目都无法改变他的不良行为习惯。

By this point the whole team knew he was destructive. But the cult of dependence was so strong that everyone believed he was the only option.

在这一点上，整个团队知道他不好的地方。但个人崇拜的依赖如此强烈，每个人相信 Rick 是唯一的救命稻草。

There is always another option.

其实一直都有其他选择的。

Your team’s strength is not a function of the talent of individual members. It’s a function of their collaboration, tenacity, and mutual respect.

团队力量和每个单独成员的天赋无关，而是有关于他们的合作、斗志和相互尊重。

Focus on building teams that value each other and try to bring the best out of one another.

构建团队要注重发挥每个人的价值，让每个人都发挥自己的最好水平。

Together, they’ll be able to tackle greater challenges than Rick could ever fathom.

团结一心，他们就可以应对 Rick 都无法触及的更大的挑战。
